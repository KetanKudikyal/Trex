# Trex Lightning DeFi Contracts

This repository contains smart contracts for the Trex Lightning DeFi system that integrates Lightning Network payments with DeFi functionality using Citrea's Schnorr signature verification precompiles. The protocol enables **liquidity mining** from Lightning Network to Citrea node hubs, incentivizing users to provide Lightning liquidity.

## üéØ Protocol Overview

**Mining Lightning Liquidity for Citrea Node Hubs**

The Trex protocol creates a symbiotic relationship between Lightning Network liquidity providers and Citrea node operators:

- **Citrea Node Hubs** generate Lightning invoices to increase their inbound liquidity for routing
- **Users** pay these invoices, effectively providing liquidity to the nodes
- **Protocol** rewards liquidity providers with cBTC and reward tokens
- **Privacy** is preserved through Schnorr-Private-2.0 approach

## Contracts

### Original Version (Public)

1. **LightningOracle.sol** - Oracle contract that verifies Lightning Network payment proofs using Schnorr signatures via Citrea's precompile
2. **DeFiContract.sol** - Main DeFi contract that executes actions based on verified Lightning payments
3. **TrexToken.sol** - ERC20 token contract for the Trex ecosystem

### Schnorr-Private-2.0 Version (Privacy-Preserving)

4. **LightningOraclePrivate.sol** - Privacy-preserving oracle that accepts arbitrary msgHash without exposing Lightning invoice details
5. **DeFiContractPrivate.sol** - Incentive contract that allocates cBTC and reward tokens to liquidity providers
6. **TrexToken.sol** - Shared ERC20 token contract (used by both versions)

## Usage

### Original Version - Verifying Lightning Payments

The system verifies Lightning Network payments using Schnorr signatures. The verification process:

1. Payment hash and preimage are provided
2. Schnorr signature is verified using Citrea's precompile
3. If valid, the DeFi contract is notified
4. Tokens are minted to the payment recipient

### Schnorr-Private-2.0 Version - Privacy-Preserving Verification

The privacy-preserving approach works differently:

1. **Off-chain**: User computes `msgHash = hash(preimage + paymentHash + userAddress + timestamp)`
2. **On-chain**: User submits arbitrary `msgHash` + Schnorr signature (no Lightning details exposed)
3. **Verification**: Oracle verifies Schnorr signature for the arbitrary msgHash
4. **Rewards**: If valid, DeFi contract allocates cBTC + reward tokens to liquidity provider

```solidity
// Privacy-preserving verification
oraclePrivate.verifyPaymentProof(msgHash, publicKeyX, signature);

// Get liquidity provider rewards
defiPrivate.getCBTCBalance(userAddress);
defiPrivate.getRewardBalance(userAddress);
```

### Emergency Verification

For testing purposes, both versions support emergency verification:

```solidity
// Original version
oracle.emergencyVerifyPayment(paymentHash, amount);

// Private version
oraclePrivate.emergencyVerifyMessage(msgHash, publicKeyX);
```

### Liquidity Mining Incentives

The Schnorr-Private-2.0 version includes specialized incentive mechanisms:

- **cBTC allocation**: 1:1 Bitcoin-to-cBTC conversion
- **Reward tokens**: Additional protocol incentives
- **Bonus multipliers**: Higher rewards for significant liquidity contributions
- **Protocol statistics**: Track total rewards and liquidity providers

### Custom Actions

Both DeFi contracts support various actions:

- Token minting (automatic on payment verification)
- Fund unlocking
- NFT creation
- Custom actions (staking, voting, etc.)
- **Private version adds**: Liquidity boost actions, node operator rewards

## Security Considerations

### Original Version

- The oracle contract is the only entity that can trigger DeFi actions
- Emergency verification should only be used for testing
- All contracts include proper access controls and modifiers
- Payment hashes are tracked to prevent double-processing

### Schnorr-Private-2.0 Version

- **Privacy by design**: Lightning invoice details never exposed on-chain
- **Arbitrary msgHash**: Contract cannot determine msgHash origin or validity
- **Schnorr signature verification**: Trustless verification using Citrea precompiles
- **Message uniqueness**: Each msgHash can only be verified once
- **Future enhancement**: Off-chain trustless verification to ensure msgHash validity
- **Access controls**: Same security model as original version
- **Emergency functions**: Owner-controlled emergency verification for testing

## Gas Optimization

The contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:

- Uses Solidity 0.8.19 with optimizer enabled
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls

## Network Compatibility

These contracts are specifically designed for Citrea network, which provides:

- Schnorr signature verification precompile at `0x0200`
- secp256r1 signature verification precompile at `0x0100`
- EVM compatibility with additional cryptographic primitives
